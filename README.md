# SVG Logo Generator

## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my logo generator! To get started, simply type 'npm install' into your terminal to ensure you have all of the required packages. Once you've done that, type 'npm start' to start up the generator!

### How it works

Simply put, the generator takes a few user inputs to create a stylized SVG logo for personal brand use. Try it out for yourself!
